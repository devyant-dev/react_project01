      "description": "Little is known about medieval sculptors, often not even their name. Adriaen van Wesel (c. 1417-shortly after 1490) is an exception; numerous documents relating to his work and commissions have survived. He lived and worked in his native Utrecht throughout his life. He was a prominent figure in the town: he served in the militia, and was a burgess on the city council. Van Wesel’s sculptures were much in demand and his style was highly influential. He left a considerable body of work, including fragments of an altarpiece depicting the life of the Virgin Mary made for St Jan's cathedral in Den Bosch. Detailed records have survived relating to this altarpiece, providing a valuable insight into the way work was commissioned and studios were run in the late Middle Ages. Van Wesel's sculptures have typical recurring features: the wig-like hair of his figures and their slightly drooping eye-lids.",

      "description": "Although many of his prints bear his monogram, others do not, and he is a party in several disputed attributions, among them perhaps his most famous print, Lo stregozzo (The Sorcerers), an extravagant fantasy rather atypical of his work. Some works are disputed between him and Campagnola, and later between him and Raimondi or others in his circle; his manner was never very individual, but his technique good enough to allow confusion between his work and those whose style he followed. The Academy of Baccio Bandinelli of 1531 is also an important work,[4] but his many prints after Raphael and Giulio Romano were the best known of his works in his own day. His print known as The Climbers (1521) records a part of a cartoon drawing by Michelangelo for a large painting of the Battle of Cascina for the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence, never completed. He made a large series of prints of the story of Psyche to designs by Michael Coxcie. His career probably never entirely recovered from the Sack of Rome; in Venice his illustrations for Serlio were not used, though he continued to produce prints after Raphael, Giulio Romano and others in his later years, sometimes doing new versions of his older works. In his final Roman period he produced a series of prints of antique vases, that were early examples of the images of antiquities that were to become so common.",

      "description": "Born in Amsterdam, he was a pupil of his father, the carpenter Willem Springer (1778–1857). He was a pupil of the painters Hendrik Gerrit ten Cate, Kasparus Karsen, and Jacobus van der Stok. He became a member of the Amsterdam painters collective Felix Meritis and won a gold medal for a painting of a church interior in 1847. He is known for watercolors, etchings, and drawings, especially of city views and town scenes that he sketched while traveling around the country. He was awarded the Leopold order of Belgium in 1865, and in 1878 he was invited with Jozef Israëls to advise the Dutch Ministry of Public Affairs on the plans for the Rijksmuseum. Springer died in Hilversum in 1891.",

      "description": "Anthonij 'Anton' Rudolf Mauve (18 September 1838 – 5 February 1888) was a Dutch realist painter who was a leading member of the Hague School. He signed his paintings 'A. Mauve' or with a monogrammed 'A.M.'. A master colorist, he was a very significant early influence on his cousin-in-law Vincent van Gogh. His best-known paintings depict peasants working in the fields. His paintings of flocks of sheep were especially popular with American patrons, so popular that a price differential developed between scenes of 'sheep coming' and 'sheep going'.",
